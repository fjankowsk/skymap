# skymap: Create and visualise sky map data #

This repository contains software tools to create and visualise sky map data, primarily in HEALPix format. The code is mainly developed for Python 3, but Python 2 from version 2.7 onwards should work fine.

## Author ##

The software is primarily developed and maintained by Fabian Jankowski. For more information feel free to contact me via: fabian.jankowski at manchester.ac.uk.

## Citation ##

If you make use of the software, please add a link to this repository and cite our upcoming paper. See the CITATION file.

## Installation ##

The easiest and recommended way to install the software is through `pip` directly from its GitHub repository. For example, to install the master branch of the code, use the following command:

`pip3 install git+https://github.com/fjankowsk/skymap.git@master`

This will automatically install all dependencies.
